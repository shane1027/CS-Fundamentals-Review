# CS-Fundamentals-Review
Going through common Data Structures, Algorithms, and their practical implementations for interview prep.

## Data Structures

- [Dynamic Array](./data-structures/dynamic_array/)
- [Linked List](./data-structures/linked_list/)
- [Stack & Queue](./data-structures/stack_queue/)
- Hash Tables
- [Binary Search Tree](./data-structures/binary_search_tree/)
- Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
- Graphs
- Trie

## Algorithms

- Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw unsigned vs signed numbers
- Stability in Sorting
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
- [Treesort](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tree_sort) (useful for online
  processing w/ self-balancing tree)
- Binary Search- - Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
- Permutations
- Subsets
- BFS Graph
- DFS Graph
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
- Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative - [good graphic on DFS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tree_traversal#/Depth-first_search_of_binary_tree)
- External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
- NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
- Topological Sort
- Detect cycle in an undirected graph
- Detect a cycle in a directed graph
- Count connected components in a graph
- Find strongly connected components in a graph

## Implementations

- Implement an ArrayList from scratch
- Reverse a linked list
- Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
- Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
- Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
- Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
- Write the merge sort algorithm
- Write the quicksort algorithm
- Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
- Memorize [time & space complexities](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) for common algorithms.
- Implement a trie.
- Learn [these](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-tricks-competitive-programming/) important bit manipulation tricks.
