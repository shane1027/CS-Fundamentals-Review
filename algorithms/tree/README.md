###### General:

- Note that Python 3.x no longer needs to derive base class from Object when
  extending classes / using inheritance.. [reading here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15526858/how-to-extend-a-class-in-python)

- Use the `super()` method to access a parent classes functions within child
  class as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10482953/python-extending-with-using-super-python-3-vs-python-2):

- Further, in order to import Python functions / classes from other directories, append that directory to the system path described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49264194/import-py-file-in-another-directory-in-jupyter-notebook):

```python
```

##TODO:  add in code snippets here of inheritance from tree class, extending
## with methods for in order and post order traversal
