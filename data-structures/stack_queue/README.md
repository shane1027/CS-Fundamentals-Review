# Stack and Queue

[WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Structures/Stacks_and_Queues):


> *A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out)...*


## Key Takeaways:

#### Advantages:

#### Disadvantages:

## Language Learning:

#### C:

###### Usage:

- Compile via `make`

- Run via `./stack.out`

###### Stack / Queue:

- Easy stack implementation uses underlying linked list, which we had already
  built

- Need to pass pointer to Stack `&stack` in order to modify where the stack
  points after `push()` or `pop()`

###### General:

- Include header files from other directories with `CCFLAGS = -I(dirpath)`
  within `Makefile`

#### Python:

###### Usage:

###### Stack / Queue:

- A `list()` in Python is easily used as a stack since it contains `push()` and
  `pop()`

###### General:
